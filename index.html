                This paper introduces Text2midi, a system designed to generate MIDI files from textual descriptions. Leveraging the growing popularity of multimodal generative approaches, Text2midi capitalizes on the extensive availability of textual data and the success of large language models (LLMs). Our end-to-end system harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of MIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process captions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce MIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This intuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation process, eliminating the need to start from scratch  as well as enabling them to generate customized musical compositions with ease. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and human studies, to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.   <font color="061E61">
